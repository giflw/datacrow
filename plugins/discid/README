   a program to calculate the disc-ID for audio compact discs
     _________________________________________________________

What is discid?

   discid  is  a  small  Program,  written  in  C++ to generate a
   disk-ID  by  reading  the  track-info  of  a compact disc. The
   disc-ID  is  used  to  identify  discs  at  CDDB-Servers (e.g.
   http://www.freecddb.org)  and  send queries to CDDB-Servers to
   get  information  about  Disc-Title,  Artist, Track-Titles and
   more.
     _________________________________________________________

Supported Platforms

   The  discid  program  has  been tested in Linux and Windows 32
   native   and   Cygwin   (http://www.cygwin.com)  environments.
   Windows  32  users  can compile discid using Visual C++ or gcc
   although  ready  compiled  executables  for  all platforms are
   included  in  the distribution. So the average user don't have
   build the executables himself.

   Macintosh  OS X support was added by Jeffrey C. Jacobs and has
   been  tested with OS X 10.2.6. It requires the BSD SDK and gcc
   for  OS X to compile; a binary is also included for Mac. Since
   the  original  author  does  not have a Macintosh, support for
   this  platform  can  not be guaranteed for future releases and
   included  binary  files  for  Macintosh  may not represent the
   latest state of development.

   discid  can be used by PyCDDB http://pycddb.sourceforge.net to
   generate the required format of the disc-ID.

Installation

   There are several ways to install the program:

     * Install the RPM-Distribution for Linux systems
     * Copy  the TGZ distribution contents to your local computer
       and compile.
     * Copy  the  executable  discid-file  (discid  for Linux and
       Macintosh  OS  X  platforms  and  discid.exe on Windows 32
       platforms)  to  a  directory,  within the current path. On
       Linux  and  Mac  OS X platforms, this might be /usr/bin or
       /usr/local/bin.  On  Windows  32  platforms, this might be
       C:\WINDOWS\system32.

Usage

   $ discid [--help] [--version] [device...]

   If  no  device  is given, the following devices are taken as a
   default:

     * /dev/cdrom on Linux systems
     * cdaudio on Windows 32 native and Cygwin systems
     * /dev/rdisk1 [Note: for Macs with more than 1 hard disk the
       CDROM may be locatated at an alternate device location. If
       unsure,  check the /dev directory when a cd is inserted to
       see what rdisk<n> is created.]

Output of discid

   The output of discid has the following format:
8HexDigitID NumberOfTracks Track1StartFrame Track2StartFrame..TrackNSta
rtFrame DiscLengthInSeconds

   This format contains all information needed to make a query to
   a  CDDB-server  and  is compatible to the one of other disc-ID
