		<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
		<p>
		This page should cover most of the commonly asked questions about Data Crow cataloguer software.
		</p>

		<h2>I downloaded the installation and now I got myself a jar file .. ??</h2>
		<p>
		Try a "double-click" first. The jar file is a self-executing file.
		If that didn't help at all it means you either you have no Java Runtime Environment
		installed or Java is not correctly setup. If Java is not installed
		go to <a href="http://www.java.com/">the Java homepage</a> and download the latest version.
		If Java is installed, type (in the folder where Data Crow is located): java -jar &lt;filename&gt;
		</p>

        <h2>A get a message saying Data Crow need full control over its folders..</h2>
        <p>
        Data Crow needs to be able to create and alter files such as the database and the module files.
        Some platforms have a solid security layer in place and will require you to change the permissions
        for the user running Data Crow or to start Data Crow with a user having the correct privileges.
        Windows Vista is especially restrictive to programs installed in the program files folder. I would
        advise to install Data Crow in your user folder, saving you the hassle of having to change folder / user
        permissions.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I supply the -dir: parameter?</h2>
        <p>
        To supply the -dir: parameter you have to start Data Crow in the following way:<br>
        java -Xmx256m -jar datacrow.jar -dir:&lt;installation directory&gt;. or (when using the datacrow.exe)<br>
        datacrow.exe -dir:&lt;installation directory&gt;.<br><br>
		<i>
		The installation directory is the directory where Data Crow has been installed
        (for example c:\program files\datacrow).
        </i>
        </p>

		<h2>How do I set the DATACROW_HOME environment variable?</h2>
		<p>
		This differs per operating system. Try google to find out how you should do this for your operating system.<br />
		Some references:
		<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;310519" />Windows XP</a>,
		<a href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/faq/q1.html#winXP" />Windows</a>,
		<a href="http://www.zolved.com/synapse/view_content/28157/How_to_set_environment_variables_on_Ubuntu_" />Ubuntu</a>,
		<a href="http://ranjankumar.com/2008/05/24/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-linux/" />Linux</a>
		</p>

        <h2>Why can't Data Crow determine the installation directory by itself?</h2>
        <p>
        This is due to Data Crow's platform independent nature. In the past I had some tricks in place to determine
        from which folder Data Crow was running from but this did not work for all platforms (as it turned out).
        To specify the installation folder you have to set the DATACROW_HOME environment variable or supply the
        -dir: parameter.
        </p>


		<h2>What is the "new" tab about?</h2>
		<p>
		The new item tab holds items eligible to be saved to the database. It's Data Crow waiting room.
		Items found by services such as the Online Search and the import are put in this waiting room so you
		can check and correct them. You can save them by pressing the "save" button.
		</p>

		<h2>I want to find non English information</h2>
		<p>
		The Amazon online services allow for German and French texts to be found. When you use the online
		search, select an Amazon server (if available for the selected module) and the preferred language.
		</p>

		<h2>I would like to have feature X in Data Crow</h2>
		<p>
		Please go to the contact page and follow the directions from there
		</p>

		<h2>Java programs are known for high memory usage and low performance. How's Data Crow performing ?</h2>
		<p>
		First of all the amount of memory used and the performance of the application is
		for the largest part in the hands of the developer. Sloppy programming can kill any
		product or service. Data Crow is a product which potentially deals with huge amounts of data and needs to present
		this data in a nice way and fast. Given the type of product Data Crow's memory usage
		is low and its performance is excellent.
		</p>

		<h2>How do I .. ?</h2>
		<p>
		Don't forget the internal help system, which is activated by pressing the F1 key. <br>
		Use the wizards to add new items.
