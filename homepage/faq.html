		<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
		<p>
		This page should cover most of the commonly asked questions about Data Crow cataloguer software.
		</p>

		<h2>I downloaded the installation and now I got myself a jar file .. ??</h2>
		<p>
		Try a "double-click" first. The jar file is a self-executing file.
		If that didn't help at all it means you either you have no Java Runtime Environment
		installed or Java is not correctly setup. If Java is not installed
		go to <a href="http://www.java.com">the Java homepage</a> and download the latest version.
		If Java is installed, type (in the folder where Data Crow is located) : java -jar &lt;filename&gt;
		</p>


		<h2>What is the "new" tab about?</h2>
		<p>
		The new item tab holds items eligble to be saved to the database. It's Data Crow waiting room.
		Items found by services such as the Online Search and the import are put in this waiting room so you
		can check and correct them. You can save them by pressing the "save" button.
		</p>

		<h2>I want to find non-english information</h2>
		<p>
		The Amazon online services allow for german and french texts to be found. When you use the online
		search, select an Amazon server (if available for the selected module) and the preferred language.
		</p>

		<h2>I would like to have feature X in Data Crow</h2>
		<p>
		Please go to the contact page and follow the directions from there
		</p>

		<h2>Java programs are known for high memory usage and low performance. How's Data Crow performing ?</h2>
		<p>
		First of all the amount of memory used and the performance of the application is
		for the largest part in the hands of the developer. Sloppy programming can kill any
		product or service. ata Crow is a product which potentially deals with huge amounts of data and needs to present
		this data in a nice way and fast. Given the type of product Data Crow's memory usage
		is low and its performance is excellent.
		</p>

		<h2>How do I .. ?</h2>
		<p>
		Don't forget the internal help system, which is activated by pressing the F1 key. <br />
		Use the wizards to add new items.
