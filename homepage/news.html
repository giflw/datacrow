        <h2>31/08/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.4 has been released</h2>
        <p>
        This is the production release of the 3.4 beta version.
        </p>


        <h2>26/08/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.4 beta has been released</h2>
        <p>
        The new version does contain less new functionality then originally planned. There were a couple of performance issues which needed to be addressed. With this release the startup time,  online search and saving of items has been increased dramatically for large databases. The performance for filling the card and table view has also also increased.
        The upgrade process has been changed. It will now check for the version of Data Crow on startup. The same functionality is used for the backup and restore tool.
        The location field has been replaced by a container field. These containers are managed from within the container module. This module will be expanded for the next version. Furthermore has new tree become available which shows the file structure of the items.
        And last but not least a lot of bugs have been fixed. <br />
        The change log will tell you what exactly has been fixed and implemented. Please help with the testing of this version!
        </p>


        <h2>10/06/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.3 has been released</h2>
        <p>
        The web module has been finished! It's available as a separate, optional, package. It needs to be installed on top of
        a Data Crow 3.3 installation. The web module allows multiple users to connect to one Data Crow instance, remotely, at the
        same time. <br />
        The Data Crow software has been bug fixed, a new online search has been added and improvements were made to the
        file import.
        </p>



		<h2>05/05/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.2.1 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		This release contains small bug fixes for the tree panel and the quick view layout.
		</p>

		<h2>04/05/2008 ~  This website has been updated</h2>
		<p>
		The website for this media organiser has been updated.
		</p>


		<h2>04/05/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.2 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		This versions contains the following new features:
		</p>

		<li>Improved file import; ability to use local art and added online service selection for the software, book and movie module.</li>
		<li>Grouping / tree panel has been rewritten to allow deep level grouping and to improve performance.</li>
		<li>User experience modes; a distinction has been made between beginner and expert users. To the beginning users only the basic option are available. At any time users can switch between experiences modes.</li>

		<p>
		This version allows more control when organizing / organising your collections.
		</p>


		<h2>29/04/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.1.2 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		It might seem I am moving in the direction of release early and release often.. Well, yes. But I assure you this is just for the time being. I am consolidating the 3.2 version and am anxious to start working on the 3.3 version. However, duty comes first. I want to get this 3.2 version as stable as can be. I think I am almost there, I think most of the bugs have been fixed and I think the next version will not be another pesky 3.2.1.x version but a (glorious) 3.3 version. We'll see!
		</p>

		<h2>25/04/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.1.1 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		One of the reasons for this early release is that the Amazon cover search implementation was no longer supported. This service was used by the MusicBrainz online search. The cover search has been re-implemented and is fixed for this version.
		<br />
		Other fixes focus on the Mass Update and the Migration tool.
		</p>

		<h2>20/04/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.1 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		Many fixes and improved sorting.
		</p>

		<h2>30/03/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.0.2 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		The 3.2 release of this cataloging product broke the image editing functionality, denied access to certain fields and broke the quick filter
		functionality. This release resolves these issues. The changes from the 3.2.0.1 patch are also included in this release.
		</p>

		<h2>25/03/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2.0.1 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		Unfortunately two serious bugs in the 3.2 version made it necessary to release this patch.
		</p>

		<h2>24/03/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.2 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		This latest release introduces a security module, two new online searches and allows for plugin development!
		</p>

		<h2>12/02/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.1.30 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		A new version? So soon? Although I am against releasing version after version within a short span of time here
		is the brand new 3.1.30 version two weeks after the previous release.
		The product is slowly recovering from the high impact changes of the 3.1 version.
		This version again contains crucial fixes. Data Crow is slowly but surely maturing. I have again chosen to create
		an in between release (this is the 3.1.30 version instead of the 3.2 version) as I want you to benefit as soon as
		possible from these bug fixes. <br /><br />
		There are also a few changes and new functionality to be found in this version. The File Renaming functionality is the biggest addition and is the first tool which manipulates data outside of Data Crow.
		</p>

		<h2>29/01/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.1.25 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		Unfortunately the 3.1 cataloging software version contained a couple of bugs which could not be fixed in a patch.
		Beside the necessary bug fixes the 3.1.25 release contains exciting new functionality such as the
		Drive Manager and two new online book searches.
		<br/><br/>
		Please create a backup before you upgrade to this version! Use the 'backup &amp; restore' tool from your old version.
		</p>

		<h2>21/01/2008 ~ Data Crow 3.1 has been released</h2>
		<p>
		This latest production version is a major overhaul of the internal system of Data Crow.
		The changes will not be immediately apparent to the average user however it has caused
		noticeable positive side effects: increased startup performance, lower memory usage,
		better performing views. This version will allow you to catalog your collection more quickly.
