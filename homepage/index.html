        <p> Data Crow has been developed by me, Robert Jan van der Waals. I started this project for my own collections. 
        In the years that followed I have made it available to the public and expanded the functionality significantly while still
        delivering the software for free. The project is hosted, at no cost, by Sourceforge.net.  
        </p>
        <p><br />

        </p>
        
        <p><br>The benefit for me to have this project hosted on Sourceforge.net is that it will allow the users, yes you, to 
        make feature requests, visit the forums, report bugs and download new releases.

      <div class="page_content">
        <ul>
            <p><i>Windows - Data Crow won't install to C:\Program Files\ folder</i></p>
            <li><blockquote>
            The setup has to be run "as administrator" in this case. Right-click the setup file and select "Run as Administrator".
            </blockquote></li>
            
            <p><i>Chinese or other characters not displayed correctly</i></p>
            <li><blockquote>
            This is not due to Data Crow but depends on the Font settings. The selected font needs to be able to represent the
            symbols and characters. The "Arial Unicode MS" for Windows environments is for example perfect for displaying 
            any kind of characters (supports Unicode and thus Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and other languages).<br>
            Change the Font settings from within the Settings menu: Settings &gt; Settings &gt; Fonts.
            </blockquote></li> 
            
            <p><i>Which version of Data Crow to launch?</i></p>
            <li><blockquote>
            Data Crow comes in two flavours, 32 bit and 64 bit. Which one to start? It depends solely on the version of Java
            installed (and set as default) on your machine. If you have a 64bit Windows version but a 32bit version of Java installed you can
            only start Data Crow using the Data Crow 32bit shortcut / executable.

        Additionally I use it for fun stuff which is not necessarily Data Crow related &#12484;. This project is <b>not donation driven</b>, 
        meaning I will still release new versions regardless of the donations made (maybe slightly less motivated in case of zero donations).

            <p><i>24 December 2013</i> - Data Crow 4.0 Development Update</p>
            <li><blockquote>
            One month (well, ok, almost two months) has past and I thought it would be about time for an update on the upcoming 4.0 version. 
            I have recently shifted priorities in the development (what!?) and have decided to give priority to the development of a full server
            client architecture. I have been updating the code and separating it into three parts; datacrow-core, datacrow-client and datacrow-server.
            (This is where it gets a bit more nerd-ish) The new core and server library have no dependency towards the GUI. There will be no more 
            code mixture (bad practice) between GUI and &quot;infrastrure&quot; code. A headless server (this actually has been requested over and over
            and over again) will therefore be fully possible. Better yet, that is precisely what I am working on.<br><br>
            I know that not all of you (okay, most of you) will not be interested per se in running a client-server program at home. No fear, running just on one machine
            will be fully supported (as it always has been). <br><br>So will you benefit? Yes. Why? Because it will allow for more extravagant feature development such as
            a media streaming server, running it in the cloud (to throw in one buzz word) and having one single point of access for you and your partner / kid / 
            friend.<br><br>
            What else? This will neatly tie in with the new web development and the Android App development in the near future (the deadline is now pushed back to 
            summer, 2014). Maybe I will run a server myself, somewhere in the cloud, to allow for a central repository. Anyway, that's not on the road map, so I'll stop right there.<br><br>
            Server-client mode; what will it do? You will be able to run a server (it will not be a complicated thing to do, promise) and connect with as many clients
            as needed to this server. Technically the server will be the host for the application settings (not all of them, only settings such as the field and
            other data related settings). Also it will be the owner of the data, the modules and the reports. If a client has administrative rights he or she can decide
            to change the settings and push these to the clients. Same goes for module and report changes.<br><br>
            What else will be in version 4.0? The following still applies: 
            <table>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Parts for items are introduced allowing a book item for example to contain multiple articles, a movie items multiple files / episodes  
                    and a software item to consist out of multiple files.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>The above allows all items to have an unlimited number of files.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Unlimited number of images per item.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Documentation update; module create guide, reporting guide, developer guide.</td></tr>
            </table><br>
            I am doing all of these changes at once as I have been withholding these for too long. The Data Crow platform is a solid one, but, it could do 
            with a bit of a makeover. Solid, as I have noticed that many parts of the code are actually well suited for server-client development.<br>
            The weakspot will still be the web application. Development of which will start right after the 4.0 version. Long term (>1 year) I am looking to replace the
            current GUI with a solid web application. All of this will run on the, currently in development, new architecture.<br><br>
            Schedule: end of March 2014 the production version has to be live. Beginning of March I will have a beta version available for testing purposes.
            Confident I can make this date as the server code and the restructuring is well under its way.<br><br>
            Merry Christmas! -Robert

            <li><blockquote>
            Data Crow, the ultimate cataloguer, needs one more major overhaul before I can confidently wrap up the App development. So here it is, the announcement of Data Crow version 4.0!
            <br>Major changes:<br>
            <br>
            <table>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Parts for items are introduced allowing a book item for example to contain multiple articles, a movie items multiple files / episodes  
                    and a software item to consist out of multiple files.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>The above allows all items have an unlimited number of files.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Unlimited number of images per item.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Documentation update; module create guide, reporting guide, developer guide.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            All of the above will make the Data Crow framework much more flexible and will accommodate for some of the most requested for features (of all time).
            This is going to be awesome! :)

            I just can't stand it when you think you have squashed a bug and all of the sudden... it's back! For now and ever I have fixed the
            issue where ratings are not shown correctly in the Quick View. Fixed some other minor bugs. No new functionality.

            it is working now. Mobygames.com decided to change their layout; the online service has now been fully rewritten. It's also a bit quicker
            then the older version, so all is well. Other fixes are mainly in the area of module creation and item import.

            Although you have to be crazy to be developing on a (too) hot summer day I actual did just that and managed to fix a problem
            I wanted to fix for a long, long time. What is it? read the change log just this one time and you'll know. I squeezed in

            Poor version 3.11. It only took a couple of days and then it got replaced by version 3.12.
            This really is for the most part a cosmetic edition. I have changed the layout a bit 
            further. This is also a preparation for the web GUI since I want to keep the layout for
            both the same, for as far as possible. Due to the list of changes made and the addition 
            of new functionality I have decided to release this as a normal version instead of a minor 
            version. I wanted to add a bit more but was ill for a couple of days, shame!<br>

            bug fixes. The fixes are for the module import and export processes. The changes are costmetic for the most part. When starting 
            the new version you most likely will get a message saying there are new resources / language files available. This is because Data Crow
            now checks whether the installation folder holds newer files then the user folder. You can choose to leave everything as is or 
            to update the user folder with the new files.

            with the table view. Then I took another look at the new module bar and thought it could do with a small adjustment.. so here we are, looking at 
            another release package to download and install. I'll try and not release anything for the next couple of days, promise ;-).

            <li><blockquote>Currently I am stabilizing Data Crow. You have seen numerous small versions being released over the past few 
            days. This was all due to the two changes that were made; one was the upgrade of the database (engine) to the latest version
            which was not easy and two was to use a separate data folder (user folder). The latter caused lots of small problems but I 
            am sure I have fixed the most of them. The best thing is that it allows you to share your data crow data with other installations
            on the network. The second best thing is that I no longer have to write data into the installation folder which was becoming more 
            and more of an issue on the Windows platforms (Microsoft actively denies changing files in the "C:\program files" folders).
            <br><br>
            I am also busy with my secret side project; Data Crow on Android platforms. I hope I will have some more concrete news in the 
            upcoming weeks. It is not part of the normal Data Crow project but it will allow you to run your modules and see your data on your
            Android phone or tablet. The initial version will be very basic (and cheap). It's going to be interesting!
            <br><br>

            The backup and restore now works correct again. The issue with the upgrade of the database not working is mainly a security issue
