loan information can now be viewed in a specialized dialog.
Items now show which items are using them; actors have a separate tab to show in which 
movies they have performed.
The FreeDB support has been re-added. It was present in older version and has now be 
delivered as a separate plugin (with limited support).
The tools menu has been split into an administration and a tools menu. The administration
menu can be used to maintain genres and the likes and to view the loan information.

[Fixed]

- Container view is now able to display the items directly from the grouping
  pane. The table view has been removed (obsolete for this module).
- Loan management, Due Date (1941130)
  Due date for loans. A due date can now be specified. A dialog has been added
  to show the statuses of loaned items. The overdue date can also be used in views.
  Two new fields are now added for each items: Date overdue and days till overdue.
  These fields can be used for filtering, etc.
- A new menu has been added called administration. This menu contains the 
  manage X menu items and the new loan information menu item.

  Crow (2.12) and was removed as it could no longer be supported. I have added the 
  functionality as a separate plugin. No additional support will be delivered for 
  this tool.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4.0.1 [PATCH]  [Release on 08/09/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch fixes the loan functionality.

[Fixed]
- [2100120] Lost "LoanedBy" movie.
- [2099205] Unable to check books in.
- [2089573] Incorrect layout of the File Import screen.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4      [Release on 31/08/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version comes with new functionality, fixes and an improved upgrade process.
The improvements of the upgrade process are mainly due to the new version management.
When upgrading a warning will appear stating that the version of your database or
backup could not be determined. As long as you follow the upgrade paths it is safe
to ignore the message. After the first startup this message will no longer appear.

[New]
- Online services are now plugin based. Additional plugins can be delivered as jar 
  libraries which can be put in the services directory. The online services are no 
  longer bound to software version deliveries and can be released separately. 
  Data Crow will come however with a default online services pack.  
  Plans have been made to allow automatic updates.
- Clickable links in the quick view and the item form for faster navigation to 
  sub items (such as actors for movies)
- Container module. The location field has been replaced with a container field. 
  A container can be anything such as a CD, a CD box, a closet.. anything. On startup you 
  will be prompted to convert the locations to container items.
  This module will be expanded in the near future.
- File structure tree.

[Changed]
- Code review: filter operators rewrite, music album importer code reuse issue.
- Removed the following message box: "save succeeded".
- Removed the following message box: "no items have been found for xx" when searching for
  an item.
- The online search form will no longer close after adding a new item or updating an 
  existing one. It will now add the item(s) and clear the form. This allows users to do
  multiple searches without having to re-open the form every time. 
- Replaced Entagged with JAudioTagger for parsing information from music files.
  JAudioTagger has continued on the work of Entagged 
- Version numbering is no longer dependent on the settings file. The version is now kept
  (in a structured way) in the database.
- New backups now contain a version number. This will be used to check if a backup can
  be restored in the current version.
- Restoring an backup of an older version will now cause Data Crow to restart.
  A restore of a backup of the current version will not cause a restart. This has been
  changed to make sure older databases are correctly upgraded on startup. 
- Table view: removed line numbering. Removed horizontal grid lines.
- Settings views: removed line numbering.
- Quick view settings: added an option to set the background color. Removed the dependency
  of the background color towards the even/odd color of the view.
- View Setting: There were all kinds of dependencies towards the general field settings.
  Most of the option were not really clear. To overcome this each view has gained its very 
  own settings dialog. Everything for that view can be changed from there. Removed the 
  visible option from the field settings. Card view item description can now be set via the
  View Settings.
- Web Field Settings: Removed the dependency for the quick search fields towards the 
  general field settings. The web field settings now contains the option to use a field as a
  quick search field.
- Removed the question mark images for missing covers.
- caching of items to improve startup times. Instead of creating all the data sets on each
  startup the data sets are now written out to disk on shutdown and reloaded on startup.
  When upgrading or restoring a backup the cache will be ignored and the data sets will be
  recreated from the database (which is still the leading data store).
  Additionally, if needed for any reason), Data Crow can be started without using the cache
  by adding the parameter -nocache. Startup times are improved by 20% due to this change.
  The first startup however will still load the items from the database.
- Before and after for Dates
- Picture settings have been added to the Card View Settings. The shown picture no longer
  depends on the general field settings.
  
[Fixed]
- Sometimes items are not added to the view after a different node in the grouping pane
  has been selected.
- Database collation was incorrect by default causing Chinese characters (and others) to 
  be stored incorrectly. This is only fixed for new installations.
- Faster image loading for the card view. It now uses less memory and has a better
  performance.
- [2039920] "Update all" empties fields
- [2039948] Save from "online search" issue
- [2032102] Threading issue with saving IMDB movie actors
- [2027395] Incorrect label for "manage states" (music album/track)
- [2030645] Front picture not shown in card view (sometimes)
  Empty images are stored causing empty pictures to be displayed (incorrectly fixed in
  the beta version).
- [2029825] Updating old record empty fields doesn't work
- [2029628] Online update on actor inside the movie module fails
- [2029637] Can't cancel changes
- [2034988] Can't re-attach Quick filter widget
- [2039939] "update all" not fully applied (view changes)
- [2005182] Initial Start Up
- [1995128] Upgrade error
- [2055353] Uncaught NPEs
- [2063861] Very Slow, uses 100% of CPU. 
  The startup time for databases containing a high number of items (20.000+) has been
  increased dramatically (from minutes to seconds). Additionally a caching mechanism has
  been introduced which further improves the starting time by about 20% on a seconds run.
- Screen lockups. Threads were running with a maximum priority causing them to get a higher
  priority then other Windows threads. This caused Data Crow to become inresponsive.
- Message box is sometimes shown on the wrong form causing the current window to loose 
  its focus.
- Pressing escape in the mainframe bypasses the check for changes.
- Incorrect message when exiting Data Crow.
  Changed the message to "There are unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to exit?"
  when exiting Data Crow.
- Fixed several possible startup issues for Linux platforms. (preventing messageboxes
  to block the screen while the splash screen is being shown).
- Fixed non fatal nullpointer errors on startup. 
- Version number was not written to the settings file making it unusable for future
  reference (upgrading).
- Messages for upgrades were not in the center of the screen.
- Improved error handling for the upgrade processes. Better information and warnings
  when the database is of an older version.
- After removing the properties/settings file the system asks to perform unwanted 
  upgrades.
- Continuous scrolling in the card view, online search and manage item x forms.
- When hiding the grouping pane all views are re-filled. This makes Data Crow very 
  slow and does not abide to the standard behavior. Only the views of the current 
  module should  be refilled. 
- Incorrect display of the module permissions (user form).
- Deleted child items still shown in the view.
- Nullpointer after closing the image editor.
- Navigation buttons for the field settings, quick view settings and the web field
  settings were incorrectly aligned.  
- Tabs are hard to distinguish.
- Discogs: images not retrieved.
- Discogs: for some albums empty tracks are added.
- Performance bug when filling a view with items with children.
- Button alignment for the question message box (yes/no). 
- ISBN 10 calculation was incorrect.
- Starting a file import multiple times results in the previous items to be added
  to the new tab again. 
- Barnes & Nobles online search did no longer recover the title.
- Old items are loaded when restoring an old backup. Cache should be cleared after
  each restore. 
- Query error when searching for titles (etc) containing a ' character. 
- Created and modified date were stored as strings making it impossible to create 
  filters (like before and after) on them.
- Incorrect filter operators for numbers and dates (contains, etc).
- (Beta bug) reports still contained the location field (changed to container)
- Adding a new module does not load the new items (cache should not be used)
- Nullpointer in the File Renamer.
- Music Album importer creates empty albums.
- Memory leak in the image import.

Data Crow 3.3      [Release on xx/06/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- This version supports the web module (which has been released at the same time of 
  this version). The web server can be found (after the web module has been installed)
  in the web server menu.
- Bol.com movie search (Dutch titles).

[Fixed]
- Typos in messages
- Right-click in the view changes the selection incorrectly. 
  Fixed by only changing the selection of no item has been currently selected or the
  selected item count equals 1.
- Update all did not work correctly due to the above mentioned bug.
- Scaled images were incorrectly stored. The format is not supported by external 
  applications. The upgrade process will ask to convert these incorrect images.
- The help text for the software item mass update stated incorrectly that a match is
  needed on both the title and the platform. Only a match on the title is needed. 
- Picture in the quick view disappears after double clicking it (opens the item form,
  after closing this form (without saving) the picture is no longer displayed).
- Exit of Data Crow after a restore (without any warning). The restore was however
  successful.
- Hash calculation consumed too much memory. Replaced with JackSum functionality.
  The maximum file size (for performance tweaking) for hash calculation can be set.
  Default has been set to 40MB. 
- Wrong item form is opened (example: user) when double-clicking on the quick 
  view panel.
- NullpointerException: Media module > Create New > Make no selection / close dialog.
- Incorrect default settings (fix for new installations only). 
- Chart tab is displayed for developers / actors /.. while no fields can be selected.
  Chart tab should not be visible for these modules.
- Fixed a bug which caused the 'Attach file information' function to crash on very 
  large files (2GB +).
- Buttons not fully displayed in the settings view.
- [1958448] Same field can be created twice using the module wizard. The second field
- Better cleanup of garbage from titles for imported items.

- Local Art dialog misses help text.

[Changed]
- Mass update now allows to update either all items currently shown in the view or
  the currently selected items.

- File import file / directory selection has been changed.
- File import dialog has been re-designed.
- WMA support has been enabled for the music album module.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.2.2.1  [Release on 05/05/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Incorrect layout for the quick view panel (comma characters are replaced by newlines). 
- The tree panel does not sort the leafs correctly for fields like genres.
- View is refreshed after an update. (only happens when the highest node in the tree
  view is selected).
- Improved startup time (performance change/fix).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.2.2  [Release on 04/05/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance has been increased and again some important bug fixes. The main changes are
in the file import; local art can now be imported and all file importers can now also 
perform an online search.

[Fixed]
- Incorrect font used for the module settings.
- Incorrect image displayed in the list view.
- Table view, new item tab, does not preserve the images. The image gets unloaded when it
  is added to the view. Also its status is erased.
- Incorrect icon for the login dialog.
- Removing rows from the new item tab fails (sometimes).
- Incorrect normalization; when searching for "Stargate the Ark of Truth" it is normalized
  to "Stargateark of Truth".
- Operations on the tree panel were performed multiple times (performance bug).
- QuaQua look and feel does not work with the Data Crow layout. This look and feel has
  been removed.
- Movie synchronizer does not work.
- Right click does not select the item in the view.

[New]
- Platform change: on database initialization columns lengths are now checked against
  the module definition and changed accordingly. (Text fields only).
- Experience modes: Data Crow now features a beginner and an expert user level. This allows
  new users to start of with a fewer option allowing them to focus on the basics of 
  Data Crow. On startup you will be requested to select your own experience level.
  At any time you can switch to an alternate user mode (no restart required). 

[Changed]
- Rewrote the code for the Tree Panel (TreePanel). It was overly complex and the initial
  build of the tree was too slow. The new tree is about 90% faster which shortens the
  startup time for Data Crow. 
- Improved grouping; it is now possible to group on more then 2 fields (levels), 
  creating a multilevel overview of your items. Any field can now be selected. 
- Maximum length for Description fields (and other long text fields) has been increased
  to hold an (almost) unlimited amount of characters.
- You can define the maximum text length for each field displayed in the quick view.
- Better handling of text in the quick view. Enters are now preserved. 
- Improved the handling of MKV files (Matroska) for the movie file import.
- The music file import had the ability to perform an online search during the import. 
  The other importers, such as the movie file import, did not have this ability. 
  All file importers now allow to use the directory information and are capable of 
  performing an online search.
- File import now uses the art present in the import folder. Using a settings dialog
  you can specify if to import local art and which keywords the art files should contain. 
  (Art means local JPG or PNG files which come with downloaded movies, mps's and software).

details I needed to fix the following bugs:

[Fixed]
- [1952703] Help does not show when using the menu option 'Help'.

[New]
- Users can now create plugins. These will be available from the plugins
  menu and from the view popup menu. Plugin should be stored in the 'plugins' folder
  of the Data Crow installation. 
  A plugin must extend the 'net.datacrow.core.plugin.Plugin' class. The package name
  should start with 'plugins' (as the plugins folder is the base package).
  Additional jar files should also be copied to the plugins folder (or in any sub-folder 
  of this folder). These will be loaded automatically. Documentation will be created for 
  this feature.

- Errors in log (non-fatal) 'Error while applying settings to column null for field 
  definition x' when the contact person module is disabled.

Data Crow 3.1.30 [Release on 12/02/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The product is slowly recovering from the high impact changes of the 3.1 version.
This version again contains crucial fixes. Data Crow is slowly but surely maturing.
I have again chosen to create an in between release (this is the 3.1.30 version instead
of the 3.2 version) as I want you to benefit as soon as possible from these bug fixes.

There are also a few changes and new functionality to be found in this version. 
The File Renaming functionality is the biggest addition and is the first tool which 
manipulates data outside of Data Crow.

NOTE: 1 This version contains a database upgrade. 
      2 Create a backup before you install this version! 
        Use the 'backup & restore' tool from your old version.

[New]
- [1729965] File Renamer. Allows you to rename files (and even move them) of a module 
  based on information entered in Data Crow. This tool can also be used to move files 
  into a different directory structure (convenient for music files). The renaming is 
  based on a 'pattern' which can be created using the GUI. A preview is shown first
  before the actual renaming starts. he help has been updated to include this tool.

[Changed]
- [1886230] The rating system has been changed from a 5-based rating to a 10-based rating.
  All existing ratings will be converted to the new system; each rating is multiplied
  by 2. Online Searches have been updated accordingly. 
- [1885034] The File Import will no longer display a message box when a single file 
  cannot be parsed. Instead it will just log the error and continue with the next file.
- Added ratings to the MobyGames search result(s).
- Table headers are now styled after the selected Look and Feel.

[Fixed]
- Help does not show when the focus is on a (text) field.
- Entered text in the 'Text Dialog' (opened by double clicking on a large text field) 
  is not saved. A NullPointerException is shown in the log.
- Query errors in the log while saving imported Music Albums (no impact or data loss):
  "Attempt to insert null into a non-nullable column: column: ID table: 
  MUSICTRACK in statement [INSERT INTO musictrack (AlbumID) VALUES (?)]"
- Children are incorrectly added to the table insert view by both the Online Search
  and File Import functionality (all to one album).
- Mass update and the online search part of the Music Album Importer did not set the
  image(s).
- Uniqueness check for items was broken.
- Picture disappears when a newly added item is updated. The image was not deleted as it
  reappears after a restart.
- NullPointerException when opening item from the menubar while no item has been selected.
- Creating a new item from within the media module fails.
- Removing / Deleting an item from the media module uses the view of the 'actual module'
  instead of the current, media module, view. This causes another item to be deleted.
- Audio CD is not removed from the tree when deleted. A refresh of the view fixes this.
- Incorrect message being displayed when saving the selected audio CD from the table view
  (save > 'Do you want to save changes' > 'Yes' > Twice the message 'Changes saved').
- [1891575] Existing book won't update and can't close book window
- 99% CPU usage after performing an online search. Occurs only with the MusicBrainz 
  online search and is hard to reproduce. 
- Changes to the font are not applied on the menubar and the toolbar(s). Switching 
  between modules does update the font.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.1.25 [Release on 29/01/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an early release as the 3.1 version contained a couple of fundamental problems 
which could not be fixed by releasing a patch. This release also contains new 
functionality. A brand new tool, the Drive Manager, and two new online searches have 
been added, Alapage (a french book search) and Barnes & Nobles (an american book search).

I planned to add more features and online searches, but, unfortunately, stabilizing and
maturing the product needed more priority. These will be added to one of the future 
releases.

NOTE: 1 This version contains multiple database upgrades. 
      2 Create a backup before you install this version! Use the 'backup & restore' tool
        from your old version.
      
See the readme.txt file for upgrade paths for versions older then 3.0.

[Fixed]
- [1879348] Online search second isbn hit uses results first isbn hit
- [1878712] Software module is shown twice, Book module not selectable
- [1878652] Cannot close Data Crow
- [1855123] Wrong year when adding CD from MusicBrainz
- [1880118] NullPointer exception on startup
- [1876104] Updating bug
- Incorrect storage of cross table values for music artist and music genre. All
  mappings are saved to the Audio CD crosstables. A conversion is performed after
  installing and starting this version. You will not loose any data by doing this
  upgrade.
- Error while saving a child record (no impact).
- Exception on startup (no impact).
- Data Crow window is too large by default, causing it to go off screen in some
  situation (low resolution of the desktop and, for some reason, on the Mac OS X).
- The software module is duplicated; it is saved both in upper and lower case 
  (software.jar and Software.jar). Added a check for other modules as well.
- Loan panel / form now has the correct layout.
- In the table view edited tracks (child records) are not stored when pressing "save".
- Random hang of the application (changed invokeAndWait to invokeLater).
- Quick Filter toolbar and Filter Dialog show disabled fields.
- When an update causes the item to be put in a new node of the tree, this new node
  is not selected. Same thing when it is moved to another existing node in the tree.
- Audio Track module had lost its genres field. Re-added and removed the duplicated
  artists field.
- Line numbers are missing for error stack traces.
- Filtering on children does not work correctly (example: 'Audio Track Artists contains
  'Abba' would never return all Audio CD's with tracks from 'Abba').
- 'Undo grouping' from the grouping panel clears the grouping AND the view. After 
  performing a search the view is filled correctly. View should not be cleared.
- Double clicking on one of the items in the online search step of the item wizard
  adds the item to the 'new items' tab instead of continuing to the next step.
- Random unhandled exception: "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException". This is due
  to removing and adding components in an not threadsafe way.
  (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4241014).
- In the view edited information is not correctly used by the item form (on saving).
  It shows the values correctly however on saving the old values are stored instead of 
  the new values.  
- Error when returning an item; status is not correctly updated in the view. A restart
  fixes this.
- Wrong regions are shown for the selected server for both the music file import and
  the Mass Update dialogs.
- Incorrect label for 'new item' menu item when templates are present.
- Error when updating a template. The template is saved, but the item form cannot be
  closed (NullPointer Exception). 

[New]
- File hash is stored to uniquely identify the file on the system. 
- New tool: Drive Manager. Manages drives on the system and makes sure Data Crow items
  containing file information remain up to date with the file system. (see the help
  for detailed information). Note that the selectable drives are depending on the 
  platform Data Crow is running on; in some cases only the "/" drive will be available.
- Alapage.com book search.
- Barnes & Nobles book search.
- Opening an item from the 'Media' module does not diplay the items pictures and shows
  an incorrect message 'there are unsaved changes' when closing the form.

[Changed]
- Modules now include a version number for upgrading purposes.
- Converted the current file size information (kilo bytes) to bytes.
- Added a sepecial file size field (showing the value in bytes).
- Add a property to modules: isFileBacked. When present, the system will add a filehash,
  filesize and a filename field to the module automatically. The module will also be
  used by the new Drive Manager functionality.

(*) View structures:

	      Old view structure                    New view structure
	 (complex and poor code re-use)     (clear structure, optimal code re-use)
	 
	            View                                 View

  * A view uses a view component to actually display its items. In the old
	situation a new view component type meant having to add at least 3 new classes
	to talk to this component. In the new situation only the view component itself
	has to be created, by implementing the IViewComponent interface. The, generic,
	View class can talk to any component implementing the IViewComponent interface.

Data Crow 3.1.0 beta 2 [Release on 13/01/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: BETA]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first beta was compiled against the wrong Java version. It also contained one serious
bug which caused Data Crow to lockup after performing a second search.

[Fixed]
- Data Crow hangs on a second search. (introduced by beta 1)
- Data Crow does not run on Java 1.5. (introduced by beta 1)
- [1869780] 3.1 installation on Vista failed


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.1.0 beta 1 [Release on 11/01/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: BETA]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently there have been complaints of poor performance and lockups. As I am unable to
reproduce these kinds of errors, both on Windows Xp, 98 and Ubuntu 7.10, I urge people
having experienced these errors to help me test this beta release.

This release consist for the most parts of platform changes; new Java features
have been implemented, the internal view structure has undergone major changes and 
the old logging mechanism has been replaced with Log4j. 

Feature requests not yet implemented will be added to one of the next releases.

[Remarks]
  I have had several users asking me why the online search is slower compared to using
  a web browser and search yourself:
  
  Performance of IMDB search (and other online searched) is slower then when you would 
  go to the imdb website and search yourself. There are multiple reasons for this, the 
  most obvious is that Data Crow needs to transform the webpage into something that can
  be saved to the database. Another point is that Data Crow retrieves a larger image,
  a more detailed description, etc, from other locations. This takes more time.
  Other factors play a role as well; internet connection speed, firewall, virus scanner,
  etc. 

[New]
- New look and feel (JTattoo): http://www.jtattoo.net/

  to indicate the installation directory (fix for bug): -dir:<directory> (spaces allowed)
- FreeDB support has been canceled. The discid reading is unstable and can no longer be 
  supported. The addition of discogs (new) and musicbrainz should soften the pain.
- Filter dialog: changed the multi-reference field to a normal drop-down / combo box.
- Filter dialog: allow multiple conditions per field.
- Cleaner implementation of most online search task classes.
- Text report (export) now mentions the picture filename instead of 'Yes' or 'No'.
- Smaller legend for the chart panel.
  Music Album now also benefits from the online search functionality.
- Added module metadata upgrade functionality.
- Package structure has completely changed for most of the code tree.
- Improved the technical implementation of the importers 
  (allow single files to be parsed).
- Logger has been rewritten (DcLog instead of DcMessages and DcMessagesWriter). 
- More flexible implementation of the implementation classes (importers, online search, 
  synchronizers).
- Selected server, search mode and region are correctly remembered. In the old
  situation only the server name was remembered for a next run.
- When updating an record (online search) the stored server, region and mode are 
  pre-selected.
- Integer definitions have changed to long values.
- The image fields in the item form are now easily edited & deleted. It also gained a 
  lot of new functionality (see the new section).
- Improved the online search for updating existing items. The actual link
  from which the item was found (if applicable) is stored and used to re-parse
  the item. 
- Selected field in the quick filter bar is remembered.
- Added 'does not contains' operator for filtering.
- When pressing "edit" to edit a saved filter the corresponding tab is opened.
- A double-click on an image field now either opens the browse dialog (when no
  image has been defined as yet) or the new edit dialog (ImageJ) for existing
  images.
- Refactoring of the online search. The implementation was scattered over 
  several classes and packages. The functionality is now structured to make
  it maintainable and easier to expand.
- The URL field has gained launch button.
- The database layer implementation has changed. To comply with future plans, the
  SQL is created using the prepared statements provide by Java.
- Renamed 'Program Definitions' to 'File Associations' in the settings menu
- Lowered the amount of I/O (disk) operations when dealing with images in views.
- Removed the "save current" button from the settings view.
- When searching for new items online you can now specify which values should be
  retrieved.
- Persons and companies are now "associates" instead of (all) "persons".
- Changed the name of the "odd row color" and "even row color" to "odd color" and
  "even color".
- Card view uses the even and odd color
- The date field has gained a date picker (calendar).
- In the wizard the button "finish & restart" has been renamed to "finish & new" as
  this was confusing for most users in case of the module wizard(s).
- Minor modules (actors and such) are no longer available from the modules menu in
  the menu bar.
- For the online search a new option has been introduced to also search online for
  items like actors, developers, etc. This option is turned off by default as the
  decrease in speed is significant. However when turned on, more detailed information
  is retrieved, such as a description and a photo. Existing items are of course re-used
  (as in the old situation). Turning this off will just create the item (if it does not
  exist yet) having only the name filled in. You can use the mass update or the online 
  update later on on these items.
- Books have gained new fields: storage medium (for e-books) and file size .
- 'Generic Objects' module has its name changed to 'Media'
- Improved Amazon search
- Sub-items like categories and authors are now only added to the database if the item
  to which these belong is saved. This prevents polution of the database after doing 
  an online search.
- Reports have been polished (a little). 
- It is now possible to point a report to a stylesheet from the properties file. 
  This stylesheet is copied to the directory of the generated report. For now this is
  used for the HTML reports. The stylesheets themselves can be found in 
  "/report/_stylesheets".  
- The logo has been updated / altered as well as the program icons.
