3.4.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Bug: Sorting does no longer work (only string values work)
[x] Bug: Cannot re-active module as it is no longer displayed in the module settings.
[-] Bug: Update all does not work with actors (and so on) (updated in DB but not in UI). Manual changes
    (using the item form) come across and are just fine!
[-] Bug: '.properties' file in the data folder. 
[x] Bug: Quick filter no longer displayed in the book module.
[x] Bug: Import of some images does not work!! (see foto's on d:\$backup of my laptop).
[x] Bug: New module, field reference to category > not used correctly (does not show related items, 
    does not show its items in the quick filter panel).
[x] Bug: Add picture field to existing module > items are not opened in item form 
   (error: net.datacrow.core.objects.DcObject.isChanged(DcObject.java:556). Refill cache if the module
    has a new field, even when it is a UI field only!!!!
[x] Bug: Picture not shown in the card view (view settings does not see the new picture fields).
    (after adding a picture field to an existing module).
[x] Bug: "ERROR [Thread-19] (ComponentFactory.java:187) - Not thread-safe; should only 
    remove components from within the Event Dispatching thread" (Search form > Date criteria (after) > Apply.
[x] Bug: There are unsaved changes. Do you want to exit? (No > exit).
[-] Bug: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ClassCastException: 
    java.lang.Boolean cannot be cast to java.lang.Long (QuickFilter, switch between available and category)
[x] Bug: Loading Module[] in the log file.
[x] Bug: Error while loading settings from file 
    C:\Program Files\Data Crow Knowledge Share\data\<category>.properties
[ ] Bug: Icons for modules not saved correctly (black instead of transparent).
[ ] Bug: Bol.com no longer works.
[x] Bug: Templates isssue; sub menu for new using template is not there after a restart.
[x] Check web application (method errors? correct modules shown?)
[x] Remove the todo.txt file.
[x] Document the parameters.
[x] Create a new parameter: -help which will display a dialog with the startup information.
[x] Update the current online search functionality. Initial result set should be small and only contain
    general information such as name or title.
[x] Log (debug) the changed fields for item forms.
[x] Are the advanced settings for HSQL still being used?
[x] Graceful shutdown settings: set to false after startup and set to true after graceful shutdown.
[ ] Provide the option to revert back to the default settings (per module + general settings).
    Provide this option as a parameter.
[ ] Error handling for defected modules has to be improved. Also it should be possible to skip loading
    a defected module. Additionally it should be checked whether there is an impact on the data manager.
[ ] Scanning those barcodes, some books have the barcodes appended by the price (xxxxxxxx yyyyy). 
    It would be nice, if datacrow used only the first part of the entered number. 
[ ] Zoom in out for the chart panel.


3.4.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Migration tool. The current migration tool only allows you to import information from CSV files. 
    Other products, Data Crow's competitors of you like, allow migration from other products. 
    The migration tool will be rewritten to allow import of additional data sources.  
[ ] Translations. There are some known issues with the Resource Editor tool such as loss of special 
    character data. The resource editor will be updated to handle special characters correctly. 
    Additionally Data Crow will feature language packs, making it possible to switch between languages.  
[ ] Exporting a module. Exporting the module definition itself currently requires manually copying the 
    module jar file and its property files. Functionality will be provided which makes it easy to export 
    and import a module (definition). This functionality will also allow users to export default/demo data 
    with their module. This functionality will also be used to provide additional custom modules. 
[ ] PreparedStatement re-usage.


3.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Multiple file support (per item)
[ ] Document handling. Data Crow does not yet handle document information (content searching of PDF, 
    Word and other formats). Plans have been made to implement a 3rd party library to allow for this. 


3.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Instant messenger implementation; talk with Data Crow using an instant messenger. 


Unplanned
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Per user settings. Settings, such a field settings, quick view settings and others are currently 
    stored on application level. As a result each and every user has the same settings as determined by 
    the administrator. Data Crow 3.4 will allow administrators to specify if the user should have the 
    default settings (current situation) or if this user is allowed to modify its own settings. Tying 
    a database instance to a user is also under consideration. This would allow users to have multiple 
    accounts, for example one per module (data separation). 
[ ] Vector graphics support (1895140)
[ ] Bibtext implementation (as it is easy to implement and there seem to be a large user group for it).
