Online services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] MovieMeter.nl online search
[ ] Book online search in www.isbndb.com (1886661)


3.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Show related items in the item form (such as movies for actors)
[ ] Loan management, Due Date (1941130)
[ ] Filtering: less then, greater then for dates (before, after ?)
[ ] scanning those barcodes, some books have the barcodes appended by the
    price (xxxxxxxx yyyyy). It would be nice, if datacrow used only the
    first part of the entered number. 
[ ] Multiple file support (per item)
[ ] Vector graphics support (1895140)
[ ] Migration tool. The current migration tool only allows you to import information from CSV files. 
    Other products, Data Crow's competitors of you like, allow migration from other products. 
    The migration tool will be rewritten to allow import of additional data sources.  
[ ] Instant messenger implementation; talk with Data Crow using an instant messenger. 
[ ] Document handling. Data Crow does not yet handle document information (content searching of PDF, 
    Word and other formats). Plans have been made to implement a 3rd party library to allow for this. 
[ ] Translations. There are some known issues with the Resource Editor tool such as loss of special 
    character data. The resource editor will be updated to handle special characters correctly. 
    Additionally Data Crow will feature language packs, making it possible to switch between languages.  
[ ] Per user settings. Settings, such a field settings, quick view settings and others are currently 
    stored on application level. As a result each and every user has the same settings as determined by 
    the administrator. Data Crow 3.4 will allow administrators to specify if the user should have the 
    default settings (current situation) or if this user is allowed to modify its own settings. Tying 
    a database instance to a user is also under consideration. This would allow users to have multiple 
    accounts, for example one per module (data separation). 
[ ] Exporting a module. Exporting the module definition itself currently requires manually copying the 
    module jar file and its property files. Functionality will be provided which makes it easy to export 
    and import a module (definition). This functionality will also allow users to export default/demo data 
    with their module. This functionality will also be used to provide additional custom modules. 
[ ] Documentation on plugin development.
