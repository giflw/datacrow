setup32bit.exe - select this one in case you have installed the 32bit version of Java.
setup64bit.exe - select this one in case you have installed the 64bit version of Java.

- Don't worry if you don't know which version of Java was installed; you can just try and start either of them
- If you can't select the C:\program files or C:\program files (x86) folder exit the installer and start the 
  setup32bit ot setup64bit "as administrator" (right-click the file and select "Run as administrator").

Enjoy!
