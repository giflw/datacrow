    <h1>Web Server</h1>
    
    <p>
    Using this dialog the web server can be configured and started.
    The web server dialog can be opened from the web server menu.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Web Server settings</h2>
    <p>
    Here the port on which the web server will be running can be defined. Data Crow does
    not check if the port is blocked by security software. For this I refer you to 
    the operating system documentation and / or the documentation of the installed
    security software. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Web Server status</h2>
    <p>
   	Here the current status of the web server is shown. The web server can be started
   	by using the blue &quot;play&quot; button. The stop button stops the web server which
   	make the web application unreachable for the outside world.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Navigating to the web interface</h2>
    <p>
    Either open the web interface by pressing the &quot;Go to the web application&quot;
    button or by typing the following URL in your web browser: <br>
    http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/datacrow<br><br>
    
    Replace &lt;port&gt; with the configured port number. The first part of the URL is
    the web server address. When running locally you can use localhost as the address.
    For the outside world the IP address of your machine should be used.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
    The web module uses the same users as the current Data Crow software. It is recommended
    to create separate users and to set a password for each.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Configuring the web interface</h2>
    <p>
    The overviews of the items can be configured using the &quot;Web Field Settings&quot;.
    You can define which fields to show and in which order. The item detail pages depend
    on the default field settings. Please note that the displayed fields also depend on the
    access rights of the user.
