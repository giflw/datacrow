    <h1>Viewing and modifying items</h1>

    Items are displayed in a view in the main pane. One row represents one item. Right-clicking on an item opens a sub-menu with further options. Items can be deleted or opened. Items can also be directly modified using the table view.
    To switch been views go to the View menu option of the menu bar.

    <h2>Grouping items</h2>
    Grouping of items is managed using the grouping pane which is explained <a href="../general/grouping_pane.html">here</a>.

    <h2>Viewing and changing existing items</h2>
    To view an item already stored in Data Crow, open the module that contains that item. By default all
    the items belonging to the module are shown. You can filter on the items so that the view only shows the items you are looking for
    (<a href="../filters/filters.html">show me</a>).<br>
    An item can be opened by either double-clicking on the item or using the right-click menu. An item is opened in the item form.

    <h2>The item form</h2>
    This form is explained in another chapter (<a href="itemform.html">show me</a>)

    <h2>Updating data directly in the table view</h2>
    Instead of opening an item in the item form, you can change, delete, or update data directly in the table view. To edit a cell in the row, place the cursor in the cell and press F2. You can cycle through the rows using the arrow keys. Changes are saved by using the right-click menu or by pressing the "Save changes" button

    <h1>Sorting</h1>
    For information on sorting you need to go <a href="../items/sort.html">here</a>.
