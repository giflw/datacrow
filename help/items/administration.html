    <h1>Administration of Property Items</h1>
    <i>Menu Path &gt; Administration &gt; Maintain</i><br><br>
    
    The administration menu allows you to maintain the property items, such as categories, countries and states. 
    The overview shows all the items in a listing, sorted alphabetically. You can edit an item by opening it.
    Double click on the row and it will open the <a href="../items/itemform.html">item form</a> from where you can edit the item.<br><br>
    
    <img src="./images/administration.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>

    If you right-click on one of the items you can choose to delete the item as well (note that you can also open it from here, same as 
    a double-click). The item cannot be deleted in case it has been used by other items. So if you have a country which has been assigned to 3 movies 
    you won't be able to delete the item. The system will notify of this. To delete it you'll first have to remove all the references to the item.<br>
    To view how the item has been used take a look at the related item tab of the <a href="../items/itemform.html">item form</a>.
