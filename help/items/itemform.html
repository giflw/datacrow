    <h1>Item Form</h1>
    <i>Menu Path &gt; File &gt; New (CTRL-N)</i><br>
    <i>or double-click an existing item in the item view</i><br><br>

    The item form shows a single item, new or existing. The form allows you to create, update, or delete an item.

	<br><br><img src="./images/itemform.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>

    Changes to an item can be saved by pressing the "Save" button. Pressing the "Cancel" button discards any changes you have made (a warning is shown first) and closes the form.
    To delete an item, press the "Delete" button.

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    The following buttons can be shown in the Item Form:
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_buttons.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
	<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
    	<tr><td>-</td>
    		<td><b>Update</b>.
            Not all modules offer <a href="../onlinesearch/onlinesearch.html">Online Services</a>. If this feature is 
            available then there is an "Update" button in the lower part of the item form.  
            The Online Update allows you to find (and use) information about your item using an online service. 
            More on this is explained <a href="../onlinesearch/onlinesearch.html">here</a>.
            </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
    		<td><b>Save</b>.
            Applies the changes you have made and saves the item.
            </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
    		<td><b>Delete</b>.
            Deletes the item after which it is no longer to be found. This action cannot be undone. Data Crow
            will ask for confirmation before performing the deletion.
            </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
    		<td><b>Close</b>.
            Closes the item form and discard all changes made. Alternatively you can use the ESC key.
            </td></tr>
	</table>
    
    <h2>File Menu</h2>
    
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Read File Information</b>.
        To read the information from a movie file, a music file, etc. go to the "File" menu and select 
        "Read File Information".<br>
        If the item already has a filename defined, the information from that file is (re-) read. 
        Otherwise a dialog is opened which allows you to browse for the file from which you want 
        the information to be read. Data Crow will read the information from the file and update the
        values in the item form.        
        </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Close</b>.

    <h2>Item Form Layout</h2>
    The Item Form is divided in tabs. These tabs can hold one or more input fields. 
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_tabs.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> You can modify the layout of the item form using the <a href="../settings/itemformsettings.html">item form settings</a>.
    
    <h2>Entering Information</h2>
    This section explains the various types of fields you might encounter when entering information.
    
    <h3>Text Field</h3>
    In a text field, as shown below, you can enter any kind of text. 
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_text.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    There are also larger text fields such as the description field as shown below:
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_textlong.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
    
    The scrollbar on the right hand side can be used to move up and down through the text.<br><br>
    
    To view the text even better you can double click anywhere in the field and a separate dialog is opened:
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_textlong_zoom.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    This dialog can be enlarged, of course, and can be used to view and/or edit the text in a more convenient way.
    
    <h3>Number Field</h3>
    In a number field only numbers can be entered (without decimal characters).
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_number.png" alt="" border="0">
    
    <h3>Drop Down</h3>
    Drop downs contain pre-defined values that can be assigned to an item. Simply select the value from the list.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_dropdown.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    In case you are missing an item in the drop down a new item can be created.
    To add a new item to the list press the <img src="./images/itemform_dropdown_add.png" alt="" border="0"> button. This will open
    a new item form where the values can be entered. Press "Save" once satisfied and the item will be added to the Drop Down.

    <h3>Multi-Reference Field</h3>
    With this field multiple references can be set on an item. In other words this field allows multiple items to be selected.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_multi_reference.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    Each of the listed items can be clicked upon to review the details (in the example above you could for example click on Algeria 
    and the country details would be displayed). To assign and/or remove items click on the <img src="./images/itemform_fields_multi_reference_open.png" alt="" border="0"> icon.
    The assignment dialog is opened.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_multi_reference_assign.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    On the left hand side the available items (countries in above example) are shown. These items are not assigned to the item
    but are available to be assigned to the item if you so wish. On the right hand side the selected items are shown. These items
    are actually assigned to the item. <br><br>

    You can filter by typing in the text field located at the top of the screen. The available items list is filtered while you 
    are typing. It looks for items where the name starts with the entered value. Removing the entered text case all items to be shown.
    
    <br><br>
    Double-click on the item to assign it. To remove an assigned item double click on the corresponding
    assigned item.<br><br>
    Press "Save" to store the changes.
    <br><br>
    In case you are missing an item a new item can be created straight away.
    To add a new item press the <img src="./images/itemform_dropdown_add.png" alt="" border="0"> button. This will open
    a new item form where the values can be entered. Press "Save" once satisfied and the item will be added to references of this item.
    
    <h3>File Field</h3>
    Here a link can be created to a file in the system. Press the <img src="./images/itemform_fields_multi_reference_open.png" alt="" border="0"> icon 
    to browse for the file you want to link to this item. 
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_fields_file_field.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    A file can be started/launched by clicking on the <img src="./images/itemform_fields_file_field_launch.png" alt="" border="0"> icon.

	<h3>Images</h3>
    Each image of an item is shown in a separate tab. 
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/itemform_pictures.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    Images can be exported, edited, added, deleted or replaced via these tabs. 
    To add or replace an image select for example "Add from File" from the "File" menu and browse for the specific image. 
    To save the image to disk select "save as". <br>
    Via the "edit" menu an image can edited or deleted. There are several options for editing such as rotating and sharpening.

    <h2>Children</h2>
    In case the module has a child module, such as the Audio CD module, you can create children for its items.

    Your items are created!
