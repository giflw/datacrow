    <h1>Merging Property Items</h1>
    <i>Menu Path &gt; Administration &gt; Maintain &gt; Edit &gt; Merge Items </i><br><br>
    
    From within the <a href="administration.html">administration</a> menu you can merge properties.
    If you have, for example, multiple categories in use (assigned to items) but they actually have the 
    same meaning you can choose to merge these into one other existing property. All the references to 
    this property will be updated and the old properties (the ones which were merged) will be removed.<br><br>
    
    Open the Administration Menu and select the appropriate Maintain option. Select the items you want to 
    have merged into another property (CTRL click to select multiple items): <br><br>

    Choose Edit and select the merge utility (or right-click in the view and select the merge option from 
    there). Now, a very simple dialog has opened. The only thing you need to do here is to choose the target 
    property. This is the property to which the previously selected properties will be merged.<br><br>

    Press Apply and the process will be started. You can follow the actions in the log windows in the lower
    part of the screen.
