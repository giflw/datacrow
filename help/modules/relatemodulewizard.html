    <h1>Relating modules</h1>

	In the main screen of Data Crow you'll find a menu called "modules". This menu contains wizards to customize, create and relate modules. 
	In this chapter is explained how you can relate two modules. Using this wizard you can make a parent child relation between two modules. 
	The relationship between Audio CDs and Audio Tracks is a good example of such a relationship. In the example the Audio CD module is the parent
	module of the Audio Track module (audio tracks could never exist if it wasn't for the audio cd). 
	
	<h2>Starting the wizard</h2>
	Start the wizard by selecting "Relate Module Wizard" from the modules menu.
	
	<h2>Selecting the parent module</h2>
	In the first step you select the parent module.

	<h2>Selecting the child module</h2>
	In the last step you select the child module.
	
    <h1>Finishing the Wizard</h1>
    After all information has been supplied press the "finish" button or the "finish & new" button. The "finish" button finishes the process. Data Crow needs to restart before the changes can become apparent. The "finish & new" button finishes the process and restarts the wizard (which can be useful when you want to create more relationships).
