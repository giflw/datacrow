    <h1>Altering an existing module</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Modules &gt; Alter Module Wizard</i><br><br>

	In the main screen of Data Crow you'll find a menu called "modules". This menu contains wizards to customize, create and relate modules. 
	In this chapter the alteration of an existing module is covered. This wizard is almost exactly the same as the 
    <a href="../modules/createmodulewizard.html">create module wizard</a>.
	The only difference is that not all information is allowed to be changed. 
	
	<h2>Starting the wizard</h2>
	Start the wizard by selecting "Alter Module Wizard" from the modules menu.

    <h2>Selecting the module</h2>
    In the first step of the wizard you have to select the module you want to alter.

    <h2>Filling the basic information</h2>
    See the <a href="createmodulewizard.html">"Create Module Wizard"</a>.

    <h1>Defining fields</h1>
    See the <a href="definingfields.html">"Defining Fields"</a>.

    <h1>Finishing the Wizard</h1>
    After all information has been supplied press the "finish" button or the "finish & new" button. The "finish" button 
    finishes the module alteration process. Data Crow needs to restart before the changes can become apparent. The "finish & new" 
    button finishes the module alteration process and restarts the wizard (which can be useful when you want to alter more than 
    one module).
