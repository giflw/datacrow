    <h1>Copy Module Wizard</h1>

    The "Copy Module Wizard" can be found in the "modules" menu of the main screen.
    <br><br>

	This wizard allows you to create a new module based on an existing module. In the first step of the wizard you'll be asked to select
	the module which you would like to base your new module on. The existing module is used as a template. The information of the module,
	such as the name, icons and fields can be changed in the next steps. These next steps are the same as for the <a href="./createmodulewizard.html">Create Module Wizard</a>.

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <li/> Parent and child relations are not copied. If you want to copy the Audio CD module for example you will have to make a copy of the Audio Track module as well.
    After you have copied both you can then create the parent child relationship by using the <a href="./relatemodulewizard.html">Relate Module Wizard</a>.
    <br><br>
    <li/> The data of the module is not copied. You can however export the items of the original module by using the <a href="../tools/item_export.html">Item Export Wizard</a>
    and import these in the copied module with the <a href="../tools/item_import.html">Item Import Wizard</a>.
