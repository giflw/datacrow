    <h1>Exporting a module</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Modules &gt; Export Module Wizard</i><br><br>

    If you have created a nice new module and you want to share it with other users you can use the Export Module wizard.
    This wizard can be found in "modules" menu.

    In the first step you select the custom module which you would like to export. The second step allows you to configure the export process.
    The last step starts the actual export.

    <h2>The following is exported</h2>
    
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>The main (custom) module.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>The related modules.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>Reports that you have created (XSLT scripts, located in the reports folder of Data Crow).</td></tr>        
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>Settings. All the settings you have done for the specific modules are exported and used as the default settings.</td></tr>    
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>Optionally the items of both the main module and all the related modules are exported.</td></tr>    
    </table>  

	<h2>Options</h2>
	
	<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Export the items of the main module</b>
          The main module is the module you selected in the very first step of this wizard. Check this option in case you want to distribute not only
          the module definition but also all the items that come with the module.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Export the items of the related modules</b>
          Related modules are all modules that belong / relate to the main module which you selected in the very first step. A related module could, for
          example, be a category module. Even if you did not choose to export the items of the main module it can be beneficial to export the items of the
          related modules. This would give the other users to chance to fill the main module with their own items but at the same time allow them to use
          the specific properties you have provided for them.
        </td></tr>
    </table>  

    <h2>Limitation</h2>
    
        <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>
        Non custom modules, like the Software module, cannot be exported. The wizard is solely meant for custom made modules
        (by using the <a href="./createmodulewizard.html">Create Module Wizard</a>).  
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td>
        Only high level modules can be exported. The modules related to this module will be exported as well. A high level module
        is a module that is displayed in the module panel like the Software and Book module.
        </td></tr>
    </table>
