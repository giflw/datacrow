    <h1>Deleting modules</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Modules &gt; Delete Module Wizard</i><br><br>
	
	Allows you to delete a custom module. A custom module is a module created by using
	the module creation wizard. Note that it is always wise to make a backup of Data Crow
	before you continue by using the <a href="../tools/backup_restore.html">"Backup &amp; Restore"</a>
	utility.
	
	<h2>Starting the wizard</h2>
	Start the wizard by selecting "Delete Custom Module Wizard" from the modules menu.
	
	<h2>Select a module to delete</h2>
	In the first step of this wizard, select the module you would like to delete by 
	pressing on its icon.
	
	<h2>Confirming the delete</h2>
    The second step shows you information on what is going to happen when you delete this module.
    Other modules might depend on this modules existence. A good example would be a property module, Y, 
    which has been used by another module, X. Module X has a drop-down list of items belonging to 
    module Y. When module Y is deleted, the reference between module X and module Y is also removed.
    <br />
    To delete this module, and all its items, press "finish". To stop the wizard (at any time) press
    the "cancel" button.
