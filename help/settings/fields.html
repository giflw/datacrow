    <h1>General Field Settings</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Settings &gt; General Field Settings</i><br><br>
    
    Using the general field settings the properties of each of the fields can be changed. 

    <h2>Renaming a field</h2>
    The label of each field can be changed. On the left the original label name is displayed. 
    This is the default value. A new label value can be entered in the "Custom Label" column. Press "save changes" 
    to save and apply the field settings.

    <h2>Marking a field as required</h2>
    You can mark a field as a required field. This field must always be filled when saving. The item  will 
    only be saved when all the required fields have been filled.

    <h2>Enabled</h2>
    Setting a field to disabled will not only hide the field but also disallows Data Crow to use this field. 
    Note that for one field the enabled setting is completely ignored, namely for the ID field.

    <h2>Descriptive</h2>
    When a field is marked as descriptive (or a combination of several fields) the value of this field is used to 
    represent the items.

    <h2>Key</h2>
    The combination of the key fields will be used to check if the item already exists 
    <a href="../settings/general.html">(more about this)</a>.

    <h2>Adding your own fields</h2>
    There are 5 fields which are by default disabled. There are 2 short text fields, 
    one long text (4000+ characters) and 2 numeric fields. These can be activated by checking the enabled checkbox. 
    You can rename them to anything you like (see previous paragraph). Don't forget to make them visible!
