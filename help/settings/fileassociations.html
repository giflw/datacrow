    <h1>File Associations</h1>

	By default Data Crow will try and find the program to handle each file type. In case this fails (or you want to change the default behaviour) you can select the program to handle certain file types.

	The file associations are used to launch a file (via the right-click menu or using by using the file field in item forms). Simply enter the file extension (example: "mp3") and browse for the executable of the software which can handle this file type.
