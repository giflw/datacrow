    <h1>File Associations</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Settings &gt; Settings &gt; File Associations</i><br><br>

    The file associations are used to launch a file (via the right-click menu or using by using the file field in 
    <a href="../items/itemform.html">item forms</a>). By default Data Crow will try and find the program to handle 
    each file type. In case this fails (or you want to change the default behaviour) you can select the program to 
    handle specific types of files here.

    <h2>Adding an Association</h2>
    Type the file extension (without the dot; not ".MP3" but "MP3") and select the program to handle the 
    file type by clicking on the <img src="../general/images/tb_open.png" alt="" border="0"> icon. This
    will open the file browser. Navigate to the executable of the program and select "Open".
