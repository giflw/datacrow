    <h1>Directories as Drives</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Settings &gt; Settings &gt; Directories as Drives</i><br><br>
    
    Not all platforms have or know the concept of a drive. To make your life easier within Data Crow (especially when working with the Drive Manager)  
    you can define which directories should be considered as drives. It essentially creates a shortcut to the directory. 
    Without this the Drive Manager functionality will not work on most non Windows platforms.<br>

    With the settings as displayed above the following drive will appear in the Drive Manager:
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/directoryasdrive_result.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    <h2>Add new Drive</h2>
    Press the "Add" button. This will open the file browser. Navigate to the directory 
    and select "Open". 
    
    <h2>Removing a Drive</h2>
    Select the Drive in the table and press "Remove".

    <b>Note:</b> Data Crow needs to be restarted for the changes to become apparent.
