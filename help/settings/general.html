    <h1>General settings</h1>

	<h2>Check for value uniqueness upon saving</h2>
	Data Crow will check if the item is unique before it is saved. Uniqueness is determined by the required field values. If the item is not unique it will not be saved and a message will be displayed.<br>
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off

	<h2>Check for required fields</h2>
	Check if all the required fields have been entered. If not, the item is not saved to the database and Data Crow displays a message showing which fields should be filled in.
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off because it could cause data inconsistencies. However, I do recommend that you define your own required fields
	(<a href="fields.html">more about this)</a>

	<h2>Show tool tips for tables</h2>
	Toggle the tool tips for values in the tables

	<h2>Show hidden fields in item form</h2>
	Turning it on means that fields not shown in the table are shown in the item form. In older versions of Data Crow, hidden fields would remain hidden throughout the whole application. By default this option is off</td>

	<h2>Delete picture file after adding it to an item</h2>
	Deletes the picture from your disk after it has been added to the Data Crow database</td>
