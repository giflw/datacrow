    <h1>General settings</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Settings &gt; Settings &gt; General</i><br><br>

    This section described the general Data Crow settings. These settings change the fundamental behaviour of
    Data Crow. 
    
    <br><br><b>Note</b>: these settings are stored per computer; even when you have multiple computers looking at the same
    user folder (see <a href="../general/starting_datacrow.html">starting Data Crow</a>) each computer will
    have its very own settings.

    <h2>Open items by default in the edit modus</h2>
    By default Data Crow will open items in edit mode. In case you deselect this option, items will be opened in 
    view mode instead. You can still edit items but you'll have to select Edit specifically from the 
    <a href="../general/menubar.html">menu bar</a> or from the <a href="../items/views.html">right-click menu</a>
    in the view.
    
    <h2>Enable high quality rendering (low performance)</h2>
    Data Crow can render graphics in higher quality. By default this option is turned off for performance reasons, 
    but you can try how it works for you. It solely impacts the presentation; it does not impact how images are stored in
    Data Crow.

	<h2>Check for value uniqueness upon saving</h2>
	Data Crow will check if the item is unique before it is saved. Uniqueness is determined by the values of 
    key field (as defined in the <a href="../settings/fields.html">general field settings</a>). 
    If the item is not unique it will not be saved and a message will be displayed.<br>
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off.

	<h2>Check for required fields</h2>
	Check if all the required fields have been entered. If not, the item is not saved to the database and Data Crow 
    displays a message showing which fields should be filled in.
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off because as it could cause data inconsistencies. 
    <br><br>You can define your own required fields in the <a href="../settings/fields.html">general field settings</a>.

	<h2>Show tooltips for tables</h2>
	Toggle the tooltips for values in the tables off or on (on by default).

	<h2>Delete picture file after adding it to an item</h2>
	Deletes the picture from your disk after it has been added to the Data Crow database. 
    This option is turned off by default which is the recommended settings.</td>
	
    <h2>Check for new versions on start up</h2>
    Checks whether there is a new release of Data Crow available (on start up). On by default.</td>
