    <h1>General settings</h1>

    <h2>Sorting method for persons</h2>
    Define here how persons should be sorted. The default order will sort persons in the order they have been saved.
    
    <h2>Default Display format for the persons name</h2>
    Define how the name of persons should be displayed by default.

	<h2>Check for value uniqueness upon saving</h2>
	Data Crow will check if the item is unique before it is saved. Uniqueness is determined by the values of key field (<a href="fields.html">more about this). If the item is not unique it will not be saved and a message will be displayed.<br>
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off

	<h2>Check for required fields</h2>
	Check if all the required fields have been entered. If not, the item is not saved to the database and Data Crow displays a message showing which fields should be filled in.
	This option is enabled by default and I do not recommend turning it off because it could cause data inconsistencies. However, I do recommend that you define your own required fields
	(<a href="fields.html">more about this)</a>

	<h2>Show tool tips for tables</h2>
	Toggle the tool tips for values in the tables

	<h2>Delete picture file after adding it to an item</h2>
	Deletes the picture from your disk after it has been added to the Data Crow database</td>
	
    <h2>Check for new versions on startup</h2>
    Checks whether there is a new release of Data Crow available (on startup).</td>
