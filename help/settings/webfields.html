    Here you can define which fields to display in the item overview pages and
    in which order.

	<h2>Field</h2>
	The name of the field for which the settings are applied.

    <h2>Width</h2>
    The display width of the field in the item overview pages.

    <h2>Maximum Text Length</h2>
    The maximum text length. By default text is not cut off which might
    cause the text to overflow in the overview pages. Setting a value here
    will shorten the length of the displayed text.
    
    <h2>Visible</h2>
    Show this field in the overview pages?
    
    <h2>Link to details</h2> 
    When set the field becomes a clickable link. The link opens the item
    detail page.
    
    <h2>Quick search</h2> 
    Marking a field as a quick search field will add this field to search area. The search area is displayed in the lower left corner of the web interface.
