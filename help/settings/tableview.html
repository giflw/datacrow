    On the left hand side of the screen the available fields are shown. On the right hand side the fields that 
    are currently shown in the view are shown. Double click on one of the available fields (columns) to add it to 
    the view. Double click on one of the selected fields to remove the field (column) from the view.
    <br><br>
    On the top you'll find a filter field. This can be used to quickly find one of the available fields 
    (as the list can be quite long).
    <br><br>
    Using the arrow buttons (right hand side of the screen) the order of the selected fields can be changed. 
    Click on one of the selected fields and press the appropriate arrow button
    to move the field up, to the top, down or to the bottom of the list.
        
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    
    Set the even and odd color and / or change the header color.
