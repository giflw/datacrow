    <h1>Drive Mappings</h1>

    In case a drive letter has been changed you can map this within Data Crow. This ensures that file paths stored in Data Crow still work.
    An example for a mapping is: D:\ maps to E:\. The filename D:\TEST\TEST.MP3 will now become E:\TEST\TEST.MP3. The path as stored in Data Crow
    will still be D:\TEST\TEST.MP3 but on screen the new filename will be displayed and will also be used for all tools and operations.
