    and the selected fields.

    assigned to this Tab. Double-click on a field to move it from the selected to available list or vice versa.

    <b>Note</b>: In case there are no available fields listed you will first have to make fields available by removing them from one
    of the other tabs.

    You can change the location of a field. Select one of the selected fields and use the arrow buttons to move it to its desired location 
    (up or down).
