    <h1>Creating a Chart</h1>
    <i>Menu Bar &gt; Tools &gt; Charts</i><br><br>

    Every module has the chart tool available. The chart tool allows you to easily create a simple chart. In the first list you can select
    the field on which the chart should be based. In the second list you can select the chart type (such as a pie chart or a bar chart).
    After making your selection, press the button. Items having no value set for the selected field are represented by the "empty" 
    category.<br>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    Let's say you would like to have a visual presentation based on the rating of each movie. Do you have more 4 stars rated movies then 
    3 stars rated movies? Select the rating field and press the button. A pie chart is created based on the movie ratings.
