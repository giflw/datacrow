    <h1>Where to Start?</h1>
    
    Okay.. I have installed Data Crow, have no idea where to start. Luckily I found the help.<br><br>
    
    I am going to assume you know that Data Crow is a collection management program. In Data Crow you
    can register your items. To allow the registration of items Data Crow comes with a set of modules, 
    such as the movie, software and books modules. You'll find these modules in the module list, you can't miss
    it.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/view_modulelist.jpg" /><br><br>
    
    First thing you'll do is open the module you want to use. Just click on the icon.
    
    <br><br>
    
    You have opened the module and are ready to start filling it with your items. <br><br>
    Now, how you are going to do this depends on whether you currently have a listing of your items or not.
    Maybe you are using another product or you just might have an Excel or text file with basic information on
    your items. 
    
    <h2>I do not have anything registered</h2>
    In case you are starting fresh you will have to create your items manually. 
    Now, don't be afraid, you do not have to type everything! 
    
    <h3>My items are represented by files on my system</h3>
    If you want to create items within Data Crow based on files in your system, for example Movie or Music files, 
    you can use a File Importer to create Data Crow items based on these files. Data Crow will extract as much as possible
    information from your files.<br><br>
    Read this <a href="../tools/fileinformationimport.html">section</a> for information on the File Importer.
    
    <h3>My items are not file based</h3>
    If you have no files to import you could try and use the 
    <a href="../onlinesearch/onlinesearch.html">online search</a> to find information on your item.
    This will save you a lot of typing! The online search uses sites (or services as we call them) like Amazon,
    Imdb.com and others to find  information and pictures for your items.<br><br>
    
    Now, there is a <a href="../items/wizard.html">Item Wizard</a> which makes use of the Online Search functionality. I would recommend you start 
    there. Click on the <img src="../general/images/tb_wizard.png" /> icon in the <a href="../general/toolbar.html">tool bar</a>.
    This wizard is there to help new users adding items one by one.<br><br>

    If you consider yourself a proficient user you can also try and use the Online Search tool directly. 
    The benefit is that you can quickly add multiple items. 
    Read this <a href="../onlinesearch/onlinesearch.html">section</a> for information on the Online Search function.
    
    <h3>I could not find any information on my items</h3>
    Well, so.. you start from scratch, your items are not represented by files and the online search did not find
    anything of use to you. You'll have to enter the items manually.<br><br>
    
    Press the <img src="../general/images/tb_add.png" /> icon on the <a href="../general/toolbar.html">tool bar</a> to a new item. This will open 
    the <a href="../items/itemform.html">Item Form</a>. Enter the information manually within this form.<br><br>
    
    Data Crow can still help you in making this as much as a straightforward task as possible.<br>
    For example, if you have files that have many values in common you can create a template with the default 
    values. Items based on this template will get these values assigned. 
    Read more on this <a href="../items/templates.html">here</a>
    
    <br><br>
    
    Now, if you have many items to add there is one last option. Use the "New Item" tab of the view.
    This is explained in the <a href="../items/views.html">views</a> section of the help. Make sure you switch 
    the <a href="../items/views_tableview.html">Table View</a>. From there you can enter the items in an Excel
    like overview.
    
    <h2>I already registered my items somewhere else</h2>
    Data Crow has the ability to import text files, such as XML and CSV (or other delimited text files). 
    If you registered your items in a text format as mentioned, or, if you can save the information to one of these
    formats you can import the information directly into Data Crow.<br><br>
    
    You'll be using the <a href="../tools/item_import.html">Item Import</a> utility.
