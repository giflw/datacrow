    <h1>The Log</h1>
    <i>Menu path: File &gt; Show Log</i><br><br>
    
    The log shows messages generated by Data Crow. This is normally not very interesting to look at (unless you are curious).
    It is however a good place to look at in case of unexpected behaviour. The information found here is also written 
    to the log file. The log file is located in the user folder you selected when you initially installed Data Crow.
    The file is called 'data_crow.log'.<br>
    Below you see a screen shot of the log. If you are really interested in all the events going on in Data Crow or 
    if you are debugging an error for example, you could start Data Crow with the -debug parameter to get the full brunt of
    messages. This was explained <a href="../general/starting_datacrow.html">here</a>.
