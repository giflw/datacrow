    <h1>Data Crow Help</h1>
    This help tries and guide you in the usage of Data Crow. This page will just ramble on and on about 
    the generics. For specific help, on a specific subject, simply navigate through the menu. Note that if you 
    press F1 from within the area you need to help in Data Crow will open the accommodating help file for you.
        
    <h2>A quick introduction</h2>
    Data Crow is a freeware product which allows you to maintain your collectables. 
    As you might have read on the <a href="http://www.datacrow.net">Data Crow website</a> Data Crow comes
    with a standard set of modules. Additionally Data Crow allows you to create your own modules if you are missing
    one (for example to manage your stamps collection) or you can modify the existing modules to add fields you are 
    missing. <br><br>
    So what do we mean with the vague term "module" in Data Crow? A module is a self-contained area in the system where you can
    administer items of a certain type. To explain a bit better, "Movie" is a module and it only allows the administration
    of Movies. Software items will not be shown within the movie module; these reside in their own module, the Software
    module.<br><br>
    For each module you'll have certain tools available. The movie module has an online search available to search for
    movies on Imdb.com. This tool is not present for the contact person module. So you'll find that you'll have different
    tools at your disposal within each module.
    
    <h2>The "Team"</h2>
    Now, let's introduce the Data Crow team. The lead programmer is Robert Jan van der Waals, who is also the founder
    of this product, the designer, the helpdesk clerk and the sales representative (doing a bad job at it since this 
    is free).
    
    <h2>History</h2>
    Surely a product developed by one person will not exist for very long now will it? Wrong.
    Data Crow is a spin off from a product called CD Library (developed again by me, Robert Jan). The development of that 
    product started back in 2001. In 2007 I decided to rewrite the entire product. With the expanded functionality set,
    including the option to create your own modules, the name CD Library did not do justice to the product anymore. 
    My wife came up with the name Data Crow. I liked it (and could not say no... still can't) and here we are.
    
    <h2>Future</h2>
    All I can honestly say is that I will continue to support this product, no worries there!
