    <h1>The menu bar</h1>
    The menu bars contains links to all of the functionality of Data Crow. This help page will explain the 
    basic meaning of the menu.

    <h2>File</h2>
    Items can be created, deleted, or opened. You can also view events or quit the application.
    
    <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../items/wizard.html">Item Wizard</a>.
        The item wizard is a quick way to add new items to the database (apart from importing them from a 
        CSV or XML file). It will first start with an online search (if the module supports online searches). 
        After the item has been found it allows you in the next step to edit the item manually. 
        After finishing the wizard the item is saved to the database.

    <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../items/itemform.html">New &lt;name&gt; Item</a>. 
        With the New &lt;name&gt; Item menu option (the &lt;name&gt; will mention the item name, such as Movie in the Movie module) 
        you can add a new item to Data Crow, manually. It will open the <a href="../items/itemform.html">item form</a>.

    <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../items/itemform.html">Open &lt;name&gt; Item</a>. 
        The Open &lt;name&gt; Item menu option (the &lt;name&gt; will mention the item name, such as Movie in the Movie module) 
        opens the currently selected item (in the overview) in the <a href="../items/itemform.html">item form</a>. 
        The item information cannot be changed using the option, it will open the item readonly.

        opens the currently selected item (in the overview) in the <a href="../items/itemform.html">item form</a>. 
        The item form allows you to change the information on the item.

    </table>
    
    <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../general/log.html">TBD Show Log</a>.
        The log shows events, things that happened in the system. If something went wrong, Data Crow will 
        log an error here. Always a good place to look if you are having issues. It will also show informative 
        messages, "I did this at this and this time".<br>
        The System Information tab shows additional information. What directories are being used, how much resources
        are available, which Java version is used, etcetera.

        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../items/administration.html">TBD Administration</a>.
