    <h1>The menu bar</h1>
    The menu bars contains links to all of the functionality of Data Crow. This help page will explain the 
    basic meaning of the menu.

    <h2>File</h2>
    Items can be created, deleted, or opened. You can also view events or quit the application.
    
    <table>
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><a href="../items/wizard.html">Item Wizard</a>.
        The item wizard is a quick way to add new items to the database (apart from importing them from a 
        CSV or XML file). It will first start with an online search (if the module supports online searches). 
        After the item has been found it allows you in the next step to edit the item manually. 
        After finishing the wizard the item is saved to the database.
