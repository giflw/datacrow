    <h1>Quick View</h1>
    The Quick View gives a quick representation of the item. Whenever you click on an item in the view its content 
    will be displayed in the quick view. 
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/quickview.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    The title as shown on the Details tab is based on the <a href="../settings/fields.html">field settings</a>. It is the combination of the fields marked as "Descriptive?".
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/quickview_title.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    You can open the item from here as well, simply by double-clicking on the quick view. <br><br>
    
    Underlined sections are items, files or web links you can click on (this depends on the type of field.

    <br><img src="./images/quickview_links.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    For items the <a href="../general/itemform.html">item form</a> will be opened. Files and web links are handled by your own
    operating systems; a web links will most likely be opened in your favourite browser, a file will be opened with the associated program.

    in separate tabs. Simply click on the corresponding tab to view the image:
