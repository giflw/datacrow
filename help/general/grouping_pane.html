    <h1>Grouping pane</h1>

    The grouping pane allows items to be grouped. Two levels of grouping are supported. This allows you to group on, for example, year and category.
    You can disable the grouping pane from the view menu or by pressing the "F10" key.


    <h2>Default</h2>
    The default tree allows grouping by field information.

    <h3>Selecting fields</h3>
    From the "group by" menu you can select the field(s) on which the items should be grouped. You can group on as many fields as you like.

    <h3>Expand or Collapse the tree</h3>
    Select "expand all" from the "edit" menu to quickly expand all nodes of the tree. The "collapse all" menu option will collapse (fold) every node in the tree.


    <h2>Containers</h2>
	The containers tree is only shown in the Container module. It offers the same options as the default tree. Additionally it has a view menu.

	<ul>
	<li /><i>Flat View</i><br>Shows all containers in a flat tree,
	<li /><i>Hierarchical View</i><br>Shows all containers with their parent child relationships.
	<li /><i>View Containers</i><br>Shows the container items of the selected node.
	<li /><i>View Items</i><br>Shows the items belonging to the selected container node.
	</ul>


    <h2>File Structure</h2>
    Shows the file structure of all items. Additionally it shows whether the file can be located or not. In the example below you can see that file "fieldsettings.png"
    can be found and the file "fieldsettings.png" cannot be located.
