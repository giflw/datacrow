  <h1>Item Export Wizard</h1>
  <i>Menu path: Tools &gt; Item Export Wizard</i><br><br>
  
  The item export wizard allows you to export items to an external file. Items of each module within Data Crow can
  be exported. Before the wizard is started you will be asked to select the module from which you like to export the items.

  <h2>Formats</h2>
  The wizard is capable to export items to a text or a XML file. XML is the preferred format as the items will be stored in
  a hierarchical structure rather than a flat, single line, structure. The XML format is also the preferred format when exchanging items
  between Data Crow installations. The XML format is also used internally by Data Crow for operations like the module export and import.
  <br><br>
  The text export exports the items to a text file. Each line represents a single item. The values are separated by a character
  which you can define in the configuration step of the wizard.

  <h2>Configuration options</h2>

  <h3>Export File</h3>
  Select the target file (mandatory).

  <h3>Images</h3>
  In the second step of the wizard you can choose to export the images. This is recommended as the images are then stored in a sub folder
  of the location of the report file.

  <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
    <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Copy Images</b>. 
        Copies the images to a sub folder.
        If you choose not to export the images a link to the original location of the image will be exported.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Scale Images</b>. 
        You can choose to store a smaller version of the original image. Specify the width and the height.
        The original proportions are kept so that will not end up with malformed image sizes.</td></tr>
  </table><br>

  <h3>Text length</h3>
  You can indicate the maximum text length. The value "0" means that text will not be cut. Data Crow will try and find the nice position possible
  to cut the text. For example right after a dot or an end of line character.


  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  
  1. The text import is not capable of exporting relationships between items. <br>
  2. The text import will remove new line characters from the values. Each line of the text file will contain just one item.
