  <h1>Migration</h1>
	The File Import can be used to import data from other sources. The import file must
	meet the following requirements:<br>
	- Each line in the file represents one item.<br>
	- The values need to be separated by a character (tab, pipe or anything else).
	
	<br><br>
	
	The items are imported into the "new item" tab from where they can be reviewed and saved.

  <h2>Select source file</h2>
  Press the button with the folder icon and browse for the source file. Define the character by which the values are seperated (default is ","). When all is filled out press "apply".

  <h2>Value separator</h2>
  The value separator indicates the characters which separates each values.

  <h2>Character Set</h2>
  A text file contains text, written in a specific character set. To import the file successfully you need to specify the correct character set. The default is UTF-8, a character set which is capable of representing almost any type of text. 
  If the imported items contain strange characters experiment with this setting. 

  <h2>Import Definitions</h2>
  After the file has been defined the import definitions table is filled with the source fields. Select for each source field a target, Data Crow, field. <br>
  When each source field has a target field defined press "start" to import the information from the source file.
