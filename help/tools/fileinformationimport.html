    <h1>Importing File Information</h1>

	Using the import feature you can quickly retrieve information from
  	the CD-Rom or hard drive. This feature is found in the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu and
  	has the name &#8216;X import&#8217; (where X is the module name).


	<h1>Files / Directories</h1>
	Here you can select the files to import. Navigate the tree and tick the directories
	from which you would like to import the content.


	<h1>Settings</h1>

	<h2>Location Identifier</h2>
	The name of the CD/DVD or the location where the CD is stored. This value will be set on the location field of each imported item.

	<h2>Storage Medium</h2>
	Optionally you can select the Storage Media type on which the to be imported data resides. The storage medium indicates on which type of media the item is stored (CD/DVD/etc.).

	<h2>Remove the following words from the title</h2>
	The import tries to get the title from the filename if the information cannot be parsed from the file itself. Here you can enter words which should be removed when transforming the filename into a title. 

    <h2>Directory usage information</h2>
    Allows directory information to be used for filling fields like the title, album name or
    artist name (these last two are only available for the music album module). The available options might vary depending on the module you are using.

    <h3>Use directory name as title</h3>
    This option is available for most modules. If selected the lowest directory name is used as the title of the item. This can be useful when you have for example all you movies stored in separate directories like so: d:/movies/title/movie.avi. Instead of relying on the information present in the movie, or using the filename as the title, it would be more convenient to use the directory name instead. Again, this is only applicabel if you have each of your items stored in a separate directory.

    <h3>Options for music files</h3>

    <h4>Do not use directory information</h4>
	Only use the information from the music file itself, such as the tag information of an mp3.

	<h4>Use directory name as album name</h4>
	The directory in which the music file resides has the album name (example ../../Abba Gold).

	<h4>Use directory name as artist name</h4>
	The directory in which the music file resides has the artist name (example ../../Abba).

	<h4>Use directory name as artist name and its sub-directory as album name</h4>
	The directory in which the music file resides has the artist name and its sub-directory has the album name
	(example ../../Abba/Abba Gold).


	<h1>Online Service Configuration</h1>
	This panel will only appear if the module supports the use of online services. An online service can be used to retrieve additional information such as covers. You can decide whether you want to use an online service by checking the "Use online service" box. If selected you can specify the online service to be used..

	<h2>Online Service Settings</h2>
	This panel will only appear if the module supports the use of online services. These settings correspond to the settings as found in a normal online search. Please read <a href="../onlinesearch/onlinesearch.html">here</a> for more information.


	<h1>Local Art</h1>
	Local art are pictures, stored on the storage medium, which belong to the imported item.
	Instead of relying on Data Crow to find the images on the internet it can be preferable to use these 
	local files.  
	
	<h2>Recursive directory search</h2>
	Allow local art to be found in one of the sub directories of the currently imported item.
	
	<h2>Keywords</h2>
	Specify the keywords which a picture's filename should contain for it to be considered local art. 
	The keywords have to be entered comma separated.
