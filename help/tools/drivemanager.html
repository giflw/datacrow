	<h1>Drive Manager</h1>
	<i>Menu path: Tools &gt; Drive Manager</i><br><br>

	There are modules which contain items representing a file (or a directory)
	such as the Music Album and the Image module. The Drive Manager ensures the file information 
	of these items remains up to date with the file information of your hard disk, CD or any other 
	kind of drive. Using this tool you don't have to worry about updating Data Crow while moving 
	a file to another disk or directory. Data Crow will automatically update the item representing 
	this file.

	There are three jobs available for this purpose. These jobs run in the background, 
	meaning you can continue working with Data Crow while these jobs are running. 

	<h2>Drive Scanner</h2>
	The Drive scanner scans drives for its files. It stores the file information in the temp folder
	of Data Crow (&lt;user directory&gt;/temp). The File Synchronizer uses this information
	to do its job.
	
	<h3>Drives to scan</h3>
	Here you can select which drives should be included in the scan. <br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> that in case you do not see any drives you can
	indicate directories to be treated as drives. This can be done <a href="../settings/directoriesasdrives.html">here</a>.
	
	<h3>Excluded directories</h3>
    If you are certain a directory does not contain any relevant information for Data Crow you
    can exclude it from the scan. For Windows users it would for example make sense to exclude
    the Windows installation directory.
    
    <h2>Drive Poller</h2>
    This is a very simple job which checks for new drives being mounted or drives being dismounted.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/drivemanager_poller.png" /><br><br>
    
	When a new drive/disc is mounted a Drive Scan is started (see previous chapter) and Data Crow
	will use the information from this drive.

	<h2>File Synchronizer</h2>
	Synchronizes the file information of items part of Data Crow with the information from your
	drives. 
	
	<br><br><img src="./images/drivemanager_synch.png" /><br><br>
	
	When for example a file has been moved to another drive or directory the File 
	Synchronizer will automatically update the item representing this file (a book, a software item, etc).
	
	<h3>Matcher precision</h3>
	Indicates what information of the item is used to locate the new location of the file. By default
	the precision is set to the highest as this is the safest way to uniquely identify the file.
	As information, such as the file hash (which is technical information, generated and stored by Data Crow, 
	to uniquely identify a file) might be missing you can choose to match on for example 'filename' and
	'file size' or even solely on 'filename'.
