    <h1>Find &amp; Replace</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Tools &gt; Find &amp; Replace </i><br><br>

    The Find &amp; Replace function is accessed via the right-click menu. 

	<br><br><img src="./images/findreplace.png" /> <br><br>

    This functionality allows you to quickly replace part a value of all items in the module with a new value.
    This allows you to quickly change a reference you have created for an item with another reference (change category X
    for category Y, while leaving other categories present) or to replacing text with another text.
    <br>
    The Find and Replace will first present you the changes before applying them (you can still opt out at that point).
    <br><br>
    
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
        <tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Field</b>
        Select the field where you want to replace values     
        </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Find</b>
        Enter / select the value to replace.
        </td></tr>
    	<tr><td>-</td>
        <td><b>Replacement</b>
        Enter / select the replacement for the defined value (the Find)
        </td></tr>             
    </table>    
    
    <h2>Preview</h2>
    After setting the correct values and pressing on "Apply" a preview is shown.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/findreplace_preview.png" /> <br><br>
    
    Here you can see exactly what will be changed. Also you still have the ability to exclude items
    from the replacement process by unchecking the checkbox of the specific item.
