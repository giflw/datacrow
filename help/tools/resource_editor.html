    <h1>Resource Editor</h1>
    
    With the resource editor translations can be created. There are several categories of 'resources' such as
    labels and messages. You can either edit one of the available languages or you can choose to create a whole new
    language.
    
    <h2>Editing resources</h2>
    Updating an existing resource is as simple as typing a new value in the table. Press save to save all the changes
    you have made.
    
    <h2>Create a new language</h2>
    Select the 'create a new language' option from the edit menu. Enter the name of the to be added language and
    select the language on which this new language should be based. Basing a language on an existing language means
    that its values will be used in the new language until they have been edited.<br>
    Make sure to save your changes before closing the dialog.
