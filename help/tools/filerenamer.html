	<h1>File Renamer</h1>
	<i>Menu path: Tools &gt; File Renamer</i><br><br>
	
    With this tool files can be renamed and/or moved, using the information entered in Data Crow.
    Files are renamed by using a 'pattern'. A pattern is a small script made up out of tags which
    are replaced by actual values when used &amp; applied.

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    In the Settings you can indicate for which items the files will be renamed.
    
    <br><br><img src="./images/filerenamer_which.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
    
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
        <tr><td>-</td>
            <td>All items currently in the view</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td>
            <td>Only the selected items</td></tr>
    </table> 
    
    <h2>Pattern</h2>
    The pattern field is where the new path and name of the files is determined.

    The Pattern field enables you to create a valid pattern by using the
    right-click menu. The right-click menu offers 4 options, which are explained below.

    <h3>Insert Text</h3>
    Selecting this menu option will display a small dialog where a static text can be entered. 
    By default all characters which would make a filename invalid, such as the ':' character, 
    are disallowed. The text will be used 'as is' when this pattern is applied.

	<h3>Insert Field</h3>
	Select the field to insert. You'll notice the following text is inserted [&lt;fieldname&gt;].
	This 'tag' will be replaced by the actual value for this field when the pattern is applied.

	<h3>Insert Directory</h3>
	Inserts a directory sign, indicating a new directory should be created. Everything prior to
	the directory sign is now part of the directory structure instead of the filename.

	<h3>Remove</h3>
	Removes the selected pattern part.
    
    <h2>Saving a Pattern</h2>
    The 'Existing Patterns' list shows saved patterns. To add a pattern to this list simply press
    the <img src="images/save.png"> button. 
    
    
    <h2>Managing saved Patterns</h2>
    The <img src="images/remove.png"> button removes the currently selected existing filter, 
    the <img src="images/accept.png"> button applies the currently selected existing filter. 

    
    <h2>Path Configuration</h2>
	
	<h3>Use original location</h3>
	This is the default option. Files will be renamed from within their current location. 
	If the pattern contains a directory structure, the file will be move relatively to its 
	current location.
	
	<h3>Use alternate location</h3>
	You can also choose to move the file to an altogether different location. This is a nice
	option if you have for example mp3 files scattered over multiple hard drives and would like
	to to move them all to a different location.

		
	<h1>Renaming your files</h1>
	
	After you have created a pattern press 'start' to start renaming your files. 
	
	<h2>Preview</h2>
	For your convenience Data Crow will first show you a preview of what the result might look like.
	The actual result might differ as the file to rename has to exist. If it does not exist it is
	simply skipped.

	<h3>Excluding items</h3>
	The preview window also allows you to exclude items. 
	Select the items you want to remove by clicking on them in the table, right-click and select
	'remove' from the popup menu. The removed items will be excluded by the file renamer task. 
	
	<h3>Verify and continue</h3>
	Press 'start' to continue the renaming process if the preview is to your liking. 
	Press 'cancel' to stop the process.
	
	<h2>Stopping</h2>
	At any time you can press 'stop' to cancel the renaming process.
