	<h1>Database Editor</h1>
	<i>Menu path: Tools &gt; Database Editor</i><br><br>

	The expert user tool shows system information and offers a direct connection to the database.

	<h2>System Information</h2>
	The system information dialog shows how many items are in the database per module, the database name, and the driver that is used to connect to the database.

	<h2>SQL Tool</h2>

	The SQL tool offers a quick and direct way to manipulate data in the database. It overrides all checks on data so it should be handled with care.
	<br><br>
	If you're not familiar with SQL, you'd be better off not using the SQL Tool
	as you might make unwanted changes.

	<h3>Creating and executing a sql statement</h3>
	Enter a SQL statement in the "query input" field and press "Run" to execute the statement. Errors will be shown if the query was incorrect (these messages are not generated by Data Crow but by the database engine).
	<br><br>
	Previously executed statements can be retrieved from the "Prepared SQL statements" list box.  You will see that a couple of predefined queries are already in there.
	<br><br>
	The result of a select query is shown in the "Query result" table.
