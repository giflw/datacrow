    <h1>Auto numbering</h1>
	Gives an item a unique number. The number can be overwritten by you afterwards. There are several option available for the auto numbering feature.

	<h2>Enabled</h2>
	Enables autonumbering for this field. The field will also be enabled and made visible (if it is not already so).

	<h2>Fill Gaps</h2>
	Reuses a number. When you have 3 items with a number assigned to each (1,2,3) and you decide to delete the item with number 2 assigned it, you can reuse this number for a new item. <br>
	With this option disabled, Data Crow would assign it number 4 instead of filling the gap.

    <h1>(Re-) number all items</h1>
    Every item can immediately be given a new and unique number.

    <h2>Renumber Modus</h2>
	There are two types of renumbering available; all items can be given a new number or only items with no number are assigned a number.

    <h2>Order by</h2>
    You can define the ordering for the renumbering action.
