    <h1>Auto numbering</h1>
    <i>Menu path: Tools &gt; Auto Numbering</i><br><br>
    
    You can use this tool to number your items. It's quite easy to number your items and also to renumber items if you want to.
	
	<br><br><img src="./images/autonumberer.png" /> <br><br>
	
	There are several options available for the auto numbering feature. 

    <h2>Field</h2>
    The fields you can select are the custom fields. You can rename these fields in the <a href="../settings/fields.html">General Field Settings</a>.

	<h2>Enabled</h2>
	Enables auto numbering for this field. The field will also be enabled and made visible (if it is not already so).

	<h2>Fill Gaps</h2>
	When you have 3 items with a number assigned to each (1,2,3) and you decide to delete the item with number 2 assigned it, 
	you can reuse this number for a new item. <br>
	With this option disabled, Data Crow would assign the next item number 4 instead of filling the gap by using the available number 2.

    <h1>(Re-) number all items</h1>
    Every item can immediately be given a new and unique number.

    <h2>Renumber Modus</h2>
	There are two types of renumbering available; all items can be given a new number or only items with no number are assigned a number.

    <h2>Sort on</h2>
    You can define the ordering for the renumbering action.<br><br>
